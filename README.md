The Farmers Marketplace is an online marketplace that guarantees fresh produce at reasonable rates by bringing farmers and buyers together directly. 
Customers may browse, buy, and monitor their orders using this web-based system, while farmers can post their goods, keep track of their inventories, and sell directly to consumers. 
With features including user authentication, product classification, cart management, secure checkout, and order tracking, the platform was developed with React.js (frontend), Spring Boot (backend), and MySQL (database). 
Administrators are able to oversee farmers, users, and goods, guaranteeing seamless operations. 
Both farmers and customers gain from the system's removal of middlemen. 
The project's goals are to support local farmers and increase access to fresh, organic products.

Skills: React.js · Spring Boot · MySQL
